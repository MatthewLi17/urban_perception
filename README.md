## Getting started

Clone this repository into your local drive.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/emilymuller1991/urban-perceptions.git
cd urban-perceptions
```

### Setting up a virtual environment

We will set up a virtual environment for running our scripts. In this case, installing specific package versions will not interfere with other programmes we run locally as the environment is contained. Initially, let's set up a virtual environment:

```sh
virtualenv --python=python3.7 venv
```

This will create a new folder for the virtual environment named venv` in your repository. We activate this environment by running

```sh
source venv/bin/activate
```

We install dependencies by running

```
pip install requirements.txt
```

Note this will only install python dependencies. We will also need other software utilies at various stages throughout this procotol.

### Setting up the development virtual environment

The `pytest` and pre-commit module is required for running tests and formatting. This can be installed by running:

```sh
pip install requirements_dev.txt
```

Now run the tests below to make sure everything is set up correctly. Then, proceed to the video.

### Testing

To run all tests, install `pytest`. After installing, run

```sh
pytest tests/ -v
```
