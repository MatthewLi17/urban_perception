# How To Download Google Street View Images

This folder contains all the necessary scripts and steps to take to download Street View Images (GSV) using the Google API. The process can be broken down into the following stages:

0) Obtain Google street view API keys.
1) Download city shape file.
2) Download roads shape file.
3) Create grid points from shape file.
4) Get street view metadata and unique panoramic ids (panoid)
5) Sample points from roads.
6) Add azimuths to road vertices.
7) Merge panoids to azimuths.
8) Merge road points to panoids + azimuths.
9) Download images.

## Requirements

* QGIS
* gnu parallel
* Python==3.6.9

## Sources (steps 0-2)

Sources are listed in sources/sources.md. These files will need to be downloaded manually for London or for a chosen target city. In addition, Street View API keys will need to be generated, [see here](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/streetview). The folder has the following structure:

```
source
│   sources.md
└───api_keys
│   └───api_keys.csv
│   └───api_keys_original.csv
└───city_admin
|   └───city_4326.shp
└───city_road
    └───city_roads.shp
```

## Get (lat, lon) pairs from admin shape file (step 3)

The purpose of this step is to sample the shape file at gridded intervals to create 20m spaced (lat,lon) pairs. These will then serve as input for parallel_gridy.py to obtain street view metadata.

1) Import city shape file in QGIS.
2) Vector > Research Tools > Create Grid
    *input: admin shape file, parameters: horizontal spacing in degrees.
    *output: grid.
3) Vector > Clip:
    *input: grid.
    *parameters: clip to admin shape file.
4) Right Click > Export layer > as.csv
    *output: download_images/outputs/points/city_20m.csv

```

└───outputs
    └───points
    │   └───city_20m.csv
    └───metadata
    │   └───parallel
    │   └───years
    └───functions
    ...
```

## Get GSV metadata (step 4)

In order to make requests to the Google server, we require an API key. When requesting metadata, there is no limit to the number of requests which can be made, although there is a a latency limit. Google provides $200 of credit each month for each API key, which is equivalent to 25K images. Store your API keys in sources/api_keys/ making an original and a copy. The copy will get depleted when running the metadata tasks and must be recopied for each task, subject to cost constraints. The python programme parallel_grid.py will read in API keys in order to obtain metadata.

This step will make use of GNU parallel to speed up processing time. Feeding as input parallel chunks of the (lat, lon) pairs to  the python programme parallel_gridy.py, which then aggregates image metadata into multiple dictionaries. Our outputs are large dictionaries of panoids of the format {'panoid': [lat, lon, month, year]}. The function includes a filter on images which are not owned by Google and which do not have Status: OK.

### Part 1

Create a new directory outputs/metadata/parallel. This will store the printed output from the parallel python metadata scrape. Make sure gnu parallel is installed and run:

```
cat outputs/points/city_20m.csv | parallel --delay 1.5 --joblog /tmp/log --progress --pipe --block 3M --files --tmpdir outputs/metadata/parallel python3 functions/parallel_grid.py
```

outputs/city_20m.csv is stdin.

* parallel calls gnu parallel
* --delay 1.5 creates a 1.5 second delay in sending each parallel chunk to be processed. This is used to feed in each API key.
* --joblog prints log to '/tmp/log' and tells the time (important! copy and paste into city folder after execution!)
* --progress prints job progress to terminal
* --block 1M splits stdin into 1M size chunks (make sure there are enough API keys for each block or make blocks bigger)
* --files prints location
* --tmdir path to save location of output files
* --python3 parallel_grid.py calls the function to be executed.

!NB for dev, remove --files -tmpdir... and replace with --ungroup and retrieve output to terminal.

### Part 2

Create a new directory in outputs/metadata/years. This will store the aggregated output of the parallel script separated by years.
run:

```
python3 functions/parallel_output.py city_20m outputs/metadata/parallel/ /outputs/metadata/
```

The first argument is the city_20m name given tofiles. The second argument is the path to parallel metadata output and the third argument is path to save aggregated metadata.

## Sample points from roads (step 5)

This function will sample 20m distance points along all roads in the city. The function uses the pyQGIS module and requires [qchainage plugin](https://github.com/mach0/qchainage) from QGIS.

```
python3 functions/get_road_points.py source/city_roads/city_streets.shp outputs/roads/city_road_points_20m.shp
```

The first argument inputs road shape file location and the second argument passes save file and location. There are no tests for this function since the qgis plugin is not a python module itself therefore must be imported from QGIS plugins path (amend as necessary in file). Python version must mast python version for QGIS.

## Add Azimuth to Road Vertices (step 6)

One step in data cleaning is to get the azimuth angle of the road to north bearing. This will then serve as a rotation of camera input when we download the images. This will be necessary since inputting standard 90 degrees is often offset and does not give a perpindicular angle to the road.

1) Import city_roads shape file into QGIS
2) Vector > Geometry > Extract Vertices
    *input: city_road.shp.
    *output: Takes a vector layer and generates a point layer with points representing the vertices in the input geometries.
3) Vector > Geometry > Add Geometry Attributes
    *input output from previous step.
    *output: Computes geometric properties of the features in a vector layer and includes them in the output layer.
4) Export layer > .as.csv
    *outputs/roads/city_road_vertices_geom.csv

In the final step we will call the function azimuth.py to get azimuth angles from vertices in shape file and merge back to our exported layer.

d) run python3 azimuth.py source/city_roads/city_streets.shp outputs/roads/city_road_vertices_geom.shp outputs/roads/
the first argument is the location of the streets shape file, the second argument is the location of out last output and third argument is save location of our new azimuth file.

## Merge panoids to Azimuth

The final steps utilises psql to merge panoid metadata to azimuths to serve as input for download. It requires the installation of postgres. Once you have downloaded postgres and created user, create database as follows:

sudo su - postgres
psql
CREATE DATABASE city;

7) run: psql -U user -d city -f /home/emily/phd/0_get_images/functions/panoids_azimuth_merge.sql.

psql -U emily -d london -f /home/emily/phd/0_get_images/functions/panoids_azimuth_merge_census_2021.sql.

## Merge road points to panoids + azimuths

The next step is to ensure one area is not over sampled, and furthermore, have an approximation of GSV road coverage.

8a) run psql -U user -d city -f /home/emily/phd/0_get_images/functions/roads_panoids_merge.sql

run psql -U emily -d london -f /home/emily/phd/0_get_images/functions/road_panoids_merge_apr_2021.sql

* NEED TO INCLUDE HERE ADDING IDX.

remove duplicate IDs

## Download Images

Now we can download the images using the final output from the previous step, python and gnu parallel. Remember to copy back the original api_keys_original.csv to api_keys.csv.
We will first convert the .csv to plain text as follows:

9a) run: split -l 40000000 -d greater_london_2015_panoids_to_download.csv ../to_download/london2015
from london2015 remove the header manually.

b) run: cat outputs/psql/london20m | parallel --delay 1.5 --joblog /tmp/log --pipe --block 2M --ungroup python3 functions/get_images.py

cat outputs/to_download/2018/201800 | parallel --delay 1.5 --joblog /tmp/log --pipe --block 2M --ungroup python3 functions/get_images.py

This function will download 2 angles per panoid, facing either side of the street. Make sure that 2MB remains below the 25K images per month quota. This can take days depending on how many images you have sent to the server and it is likely that errors will occur.
